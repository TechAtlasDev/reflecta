# üöÄ Reflecta

**Reflecta** is an interactive tool designed to democratize access to and analysis of data provided by NASA's **Landsat 9** satellite. Our platform allows users, from beginners to experts, to explore multispectral images of the Earth and apply various analyses without technical barriers.

With **Reflecta**, we aim to open new possibilities for scientific research, environmental monitoring, and the prediction of natural phenomena by making satellite imagery accessible and educational.

## üåç What is Reflecta?

Reflecta is a web platform that simplifies access to the images and data captured by **Landsat 9**. While the satellite is a powerful tool, it can be difficult to use for those without technical expertise. Reflecta breaks down this barrier by offering an interactive and educational tool, suitable for scientists, students, and anyone curious about space and Earth observation.

### üéØ Objective
Make the use of **Landsat 9** data accessible to the general public through:
1. **Exploration of satellite images**.
2. **Custom filter applications and analysis tools**.
3. **Educational resources on satellite technologies and Earth observation**.

---

## ‚öíÔ∏è Key Focus Areas

Reflecta was developed around three core pillars that cover the usage of satellite data:

1. **üï∞Ô∏è Past**: Historical image analysis and processing.
2. **üìå Present**: Current data visualization and interpretation.
3. **üß¨ Future**: Predictive analysis and natural phenomenon forecasting.

These pillars allow us to offer a complete experience, ranging from educational tools to predictive analytics.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

Reflecta is built using a modern and efficient tech stack to ensure a smooth and accessible user experience. Below are the key technologies used:

### **Front-end** (User Interface):
1. **React.js**: JavaScript framework for building dynamic, interactive user interfaces. React was chosen for its component-based architecture and integration with modern development tools.
2. **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows us to rapidly design customizable and responsive user interfaces without overloading the web with unnecessary styles.
3. **Shadcn**: A component system that integrates with TailwindCSS, ensuring accessible and cohesive design practices.
4. **DaisyUI**: A TailwindCSS extension that provides pre-built, customizable UI components, speeding up development and enhancing user experience.
5. **Vite**: A fast build tool that improves performance during the development process, ensuring faster load times and a modern workflow.

### **Back-end** (Business Logic):
1. **Django (Python)**: A robust web framework that handles server logic, security, and user management. Django is ideal for rapid development with scalability in mind.
2. **Django Rest Framework (Python)**: An extension of Django for building REST APIs. It serves as the backbone for efficient communication between the front-end and back-end.
3. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: We use JWT for handling authentication, ensuring secure and private interactions for all users.
4. **Google Earth Engine (GEE) - Python**: API for processing and analyzing large volumes of satellite imagery, giving us access to Landsat 9 data and other satellite sources.

### **Database**:
1. **SQLite (Development)**: Lightweight and easy-to-use database for the development environment.
2. **PostgreSQL (Production)**: A powerful relational database used in production to handle user data and satellite image management. We use **Supabase** as our database provider, offering a simple yet powerful abstraction layer.

### **Hosting**:
1. **Vercel**: A hosting platform optimized for modern web applications, perfect for React-based projects and static sites. Vercel allows us to deploy updates continuously and handle traffic efficiently.
